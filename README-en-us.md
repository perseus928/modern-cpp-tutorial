## Targets

- This book assumes that readers are already familiar with traditional C++ (e.g. C++98), at least they do not have any difficulty in reading traditional C++ code. In other words, those who have long experience in traditional C++ and people who desire to quickly understand the features of modern C++ in a short period of time are well suited to read the book;

- This book introduces to a certain extent of the dark magic of modern C++. However, these magics are very limited, they are not suitable for readers who want to learn advanced C++.
